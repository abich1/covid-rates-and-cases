# Lab 3: Web Map Application

Lab 3: Web Map Application for GEOG 458 explores building two thematic maps, one choropleth map showcasing the COVID-19 cases in map1.html and rates and a proportional symbols map showcasing COVID-19 cases in map2.html. The data for these maps come from different locations, with the COVID-19 case/death data from [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/43d32dde2f87bd4dafbb7d23f5d9e878124018b8/live/us-counties.csv) and the case rates population data from the [2018 ACS 5 year estimates](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0100000US.050000&d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Data%20Profiles&tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&hidePreview=true).

These maps were created with the help of VS Code and Mapbox.
